# Main Purpose:

I always want to game on one machine and work on the other one. But the windows is getting worse and worse with each update feature. So why not create and tweak my own iso/windows. So here is the step by step to create your own custom windows.

# Steps:

1. Download the iso file (I use Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021) from https://github.com/massgravel/massgrave.dev/blob/main/docs/windows_ltsc_links.md

I recommend doing this from fresh install to control variables, you can do it for win 10/11 any version. (Prefer win 10 over 11)

2. Tweaking the iso file using NTLite or other similar software. If you do not want to spend extra time on this one, it is not necessary.

I recommend removing all the updates you can remove(there are many it will not let you remove) and all the components, disable all the features. 

3. Donwload Rufus to install the iso to a USB drive.

4. Unplug your ethernet cable before installing windows
